If you'd like to view the main repository, it's
[here](https://github.com/spinnylights/some_sort_of_game_engine).

Right now most of the work taking place is on the graphics code.
The entry point for the engine as a whole is the
[Engine](classcu_1_1Engine.html) class, and the entry point for
the graphics is the [Vulkan](classcu_1_1Vulkan.html) class.
